PROJECT DESCRIPTION
    The cost of acquiring a new customers can cost five times more than retaining the existing customers. US companies lose $136.8 billion per year due to avoidable consumer switching.The success rate of selling to an existing customer is around 60%-70%, while it is only at around (5-20) % with new customers. Due to these reasons retaining customers is just as important as, if not more important than, acquiring new ones. In this project different attributes(i.e features) of the customers will be analyzed to see if customers will indeed churn or not. A list of customers(.CSV) bound to churn
